## What I learned 
1. Next.JS
   - Utilizing this framework provided features and optimization out of the box which allowed for quicker development and deployment.  
2. TypeScript
  - Introducing TypeScript to this project allowed me to expand my knowledge on topics/features such as static typing, enhanced editor support, and error prevention. Employing these key aspects allowed for a more robust, maintainable, and error-resistant development experience
